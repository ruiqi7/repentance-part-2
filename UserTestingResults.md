- Mouse sensitivity too high
- Esc full screen
- Way too dark without flashlight
- Couldn’t turn on flashlight
- NPCs too hard to find
- Knife in inventory misleading 
- Opened a letter and it went to game over???? But still could move
- Two monsters since did a 360? 
- One round found absolutely nothing
- No interest in the storyline

**Participant 2**

Task 1:

- Run and light thing on the side
- Wasd to move was intuitive 
- Some kind of mystery, spooky

Task 2:

- Was the flashlight intuitive?

- How was the length of the instructions? – is it too long making it boring? – does it make it too easy to die?

  - It’s fine because you  can sit and read or start moving around
  - Felt like a nice length

- Mouse sensitivity too high

- Asked if you can fight the monsters with the knife

- Garbled text when speaking to NPC at the same time as original text

- Can’t find any items

- Stamina bar and left shift were good 

- Check points if possible so once you die you don’t do house again

Task 3:

- Unable to find items
- Stamina amount is good
- Light amount may of may not be good
- Maze is confusing but not too bad (right level of confusing)

Overall comments:

- Style cohesive
- Style 
- Gameplay is alright
- Connects to music well
- Spend all the time looking at the floor
- Without flashlight way too dark so can’t conserve it at all

| Was there anything in the game that felt out of place? If there was, please describe.                       | he knife being in the inventory.

| What would you consider to be the strongest aspect of this game? (Art , Music, Atmosphere, Story, Gameplay) | Atmosphere, soundtrack and the crows made it feel creepy.

| What did you like most about the gameplay mechanics and dynamics in the game?                               | The graphics look very cool! The colour scheme and music at the beginning definitely helps establish the tone for the game. I like that there was logic behind having to refrain from using Left Shift to run in order to save your stamina. It added some urgency and realism to some extent in knowing when you need to use your stamina.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| What did you not like most about the gameplay mechanics and dynamics in the game?                           | The flickering of the flashlight is a bit too much at the start, since even though the flashlight bar is still quite high the flashlight flickers like it’s going to run out of battery soon. This made it very hard to see where I was going.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Were there any aspects of the gameplay that you found confusing or frustrating? If so, please describe.     | I don’t think the purpose of collecting the items was made very clear. Whenever I collect an item I don’t really know what they’re for. It feels like there’s some background context as to what each item is meant to do but this isn’t translated well through the gameplay in itself. There was also a time where I had collected many items and my flashlight battery went out, but for some reason the game continued on and I couldn’t see anything. In the end I died but I don’t remember hearing any heartbeats prior to that. |
| How would you summarize the storyline of the game?                                                          | The player was a descendent of the person that murdered the family who have become monsters. These monsters are hunting the player down to get revenge. The aim is to collect items and discover more clues in the letters scattered around the maze while surviving for 5 minutes without dying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Were you at any point in the game confused or lost about what to do?                                        | I was quite confused about what to do when I first played it because I kept getting lost in the maze without finding any items (but that was because of a bug). I think it can get quite disorientating going from the letter in the house to suddenly being outside in the dark being surrounded by a maze.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

I’m not so sure whether all of them (only encountered two) provide super helpful information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Their distorted features and the way they jump scare and speed up when approaching you is extremely scary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| What would you consider to be the strongest aspect of this game? (Art , Music, Atmosphere, Story, Gameplay) | I think the whole atmosphere of the game was very well done, I was genuinely scared replaying the game no matter how many times I played it. The music, the flickering of the flashlight and the heartbeats really heightened the creepy vibes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| What would you consider to be the weakest aspect of this game?                                              | I think probably the whole explanation of the purpose behind the items. Playing it for the first time, I didn’t really understand what I was supposed to do, even after reading the text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| If there was one thing you could add to this game, what would it be?                                        | I think weaving the significance of the items into the storyline and gameplay would be useful. Context such as the graves and items and how they were related to the monsters wasn’t very clear. I wouldn’t have known about it if I wasn’t told. I think it relies too heavily on the player finding the specific letters to discover this information, and if they don’t they would be left feeling confused.                                                                                                                         |

| What did you like most about the gameplay mechanics and dynamics in the game?                               | The mechanics followed well-known controls that would allow for people to easily navigate the game without having to learn complicated keys.  It also had a very nice indie-game atmosphere and design.  |
| What did you not like most about the gameplay mechanics and dynamics in the game?                           | It was a very fun and engaging game – I just wish I could see it a bit better                                                                                                                            |
| Were there any aspects of the gameplay that you found confusing or frustrating? If so, please describe.     | How to use the items in the maze was a little confusing, but it was overall very engaging and exciting to play – would play this in my own time.                                                         |
| How would you summarize the storyline of the game?                                                          | I’m assuming players play from the perspective of a monster/descendent of “monsters” who has to navigate the resting place of previous victims whose souls want revenge.                                 |
| Were you at any point in the game confused or lost about what to do?                                        | Was not aware there was going to be a maze, or what to do with the items within, but I found controls and even utilising the items picked up very easy and accessible.                                   |
| How did you feel about the NPCs in this game?                                                               | I didn’t know it was an NPC – I thought it was a potential jumpscare.                                                                                                                                    |
| How would you describe the monsters in this game?                                                           | They were shocking to see, which helped make the game engaging and exciting.                                                                                                                             |
| Was there anything in the game that felt out of place? If there was, please describe.                       | Not really – I thought everything was well put together, including the design.                                                                                                                           |
| What would you consider to be the strongest aspect of this game? (Art , Music, Atmosphere, Story, Gameplay) | I really love the atmosphere – this kind of indie horror vibe is something I’m really into.  The music and art really help create an anxiety inducing feeling.                                           |
| What would you consider to be the weakest aspect of this game?                                              | Maybe time restraints prevent users from really exploring all the nice detail, like how to use some of the items within.                                                                                 |
| If there was one thing you could add to this game, what would it be?                                        | Brighter flashlight would help gameplay!                                                                                                                                                                 |

**Participant 9**

- blindly ran around the maze
- Didn’t know if they should wait for stamina to refill before running or just run instantly from monster when it wasn’t too close yet
- Tried waiting for stamina to refill before running away from monster if they weren’t too close 
- Wondered if heartbeat meant the monster was near since sometimes they would be killed when there was no heartbeat 
- Wondered if the bird noises meant anything 
- Didn’t realise they couldn’t go back into the house 
- Ran into walls a few times 
- Hesitant to talk to npc since it was scary (didn’t end up talking to npc at all)
- Sometimes ran in circles and kept ending up back at the start
- Found items but didn’t know what to do with them
- Tried to kill monster with the knife

**Participant 10**

- Sensitivity option needed (sensitivity was too high)
- No thank you to the NPC 
- Can’t do anything without the flashlight 
- Didn’t notice heartbeats -> heartbeats should intensify when monsters get closer ?
- Why do the NPCs look like the monsters? 
- About wasn’t clear about the objective at the start -> thought collecting items was an objective 
- Good ambiance from flashlight flickering but difficult to see anything 
- Can’t read the notes clearly in the maze
- Didn’t realise the doll was for child monster 
- Salt looks like a hat 
- Can’t find any npcs for a while  
- Didn’t know how to use eyeball jar 
- Too much dialogue -> could speed up text and add scary speech voice over? 
- More upgrades -> feel more satisfying 
- Lack of point to read notes after a while
- Didn’t pay much attention to the backstory 
- Stopped reading dialogue etc after a while
- Monster runs really quick in hard mode -> was hard to run away after getting spotted 
- Blindly running around 
- Kept getting lost and going in circles -> Needs something to mark out where players have gone or have places that stay constant 
- Did not notice game started instantly after getting to the maze part since it was so dark
- Initially did not realise they started at the house in the maze (they ran straight ahead without looking around starting area first)

**Participant 11**

- did not notice you could pick up items for a while
- Didn’t know game started instantly when getting into the maze 
- Won in easy mode and only saw monster once on their first try

- Read the dialogue 
- Figured out the controls quickly 
- Talked to the npc at the start

**Participant 12**

- Tried to kill monster with the knife
- Tried to use flashlight by pressing 2 
- Didn’t realise game started as soon as they got into maze since it was dark
- Thought npc was a monster 
- Did not know the aim of the game 
- Read the letter 
- Read the dialogue but didn’t completely understand the controls -> would be better to have L shift and F underneath the bars in ui?

- Found other npcs but didn’t talk to them since they thought they were monsters 
- Didn’t realise they could pick up the candles

- 
**Participant 12 - 20 summary**
_General_

- Unclear that the goal of the game is to survive

  - Most don’t read the ‘About’ page before starting the game
  - Some thought the goal is to collect items

<!---->

- Difference between easy and hard mode is unclear
- Troublesome to have to enter the game through the house → add a button to restart the game in the maze directly DONE

 _Instructions / Controls_

- Instructions dialogue is too slow and long, and most don’t read → freeze the monsters for a while at the start OR give instructions in the intro scene instead and don’t allow skipping of the text DONE
- Mouse sensitivity is a little high → allow the player to adjust DONE

_IntroScene & Storyline_

- House is too far away

- Player could exit the world and get stuck

- Letter is too long that most don’t bother reading

- Unclear storyline eg. letter mistakenly implies that the player is the monster

- Transition into the maze is too abrupt and confusing

- Sound is too soft

- A suggestion to improve understanding of storyline and allow the player to familiarize with the controls before the start of the game was to

  - Have the letter (instead of the heirloom) and flashlight in the inventory at the start

  - Upon clicking ‘Start’, transition into the intro scene with the letter already open

  - Player can close the letter by ‘X’ like how it already is, but can also reopen the letter by pressing ‘1’

  - Family gave the player the letter confessing their sins in a very vague manner

  - Player will want to enter the house to find out more about what happened

  - Once the player enters the house, have the monsters narrate the rest of the storyline OR show through dialogue and play gibberish + scary monster sounds

    - How dare you still enter our house?
    - We will avenge / seek revenge…

_Gameplay_

- Poor indication of when the monster is approaching / nearby → should have sound / dialogue otherwise the player has no chance / nothing to do once the flashlight dies

- Unclear how much time is left

- A suggestion was to have a safe zone for a limited time (eg. 10 - 20 seconds) when the player is near the house / graves and NPCs to let the player interact safely for a while (some also misunderstood it as the NPCs harming them because they died while interacting with it)

  - If the monster is near, it stops and stares / hovers around until the safe zone ends
  - Have a timer (in the form of a pie chart) to indicate how long more the safezone lasts 

_Player Death_

- Dies right at the start → freeze the monsters for a while at the start
- Dies without seeing the monster → maybe include sounds / dialogue to indicate that a monster is near, turn on the flashlight if the player didn't have it on when he died
- Sound upon death is too soft
- Could still toggle the flashlight → disable it?

_Flashlight_

- Unclear that it has a battery → a suggestion was to put the bars at the top because the player focus is on the center of the screen
- Sometimes the light is too dark so the player misunderstood it as not working

_Items & Inventory_

- Difficulty of finding items seems inconsistent between rounds
- Player dies while understanding how to use → maybe shorten the length + increase the speed of the text
- Thought the heirloom can be used to kill the monsters → maybe remove it / give it some purpose other than lore
- Thought the flashlight can be used by interacting with the inventory → maybe allow that instead of using F / remove flashlight from inventory
- Unclear how to use the items in the inventory → maybe explain upon item collection (eg. mention name of item + which number to click to use it)
- Some thought the salt looked like a Vietnamese farmer hat XD
- A bit hard to pick up → increase the range of the raycast
- Salt didn’t repel the monster once the monster already got too close (player just put down the salt and then died)
- Unclear that graves are at the side of the house and also hard to find the way back to the graves after leaving it → maybe give some guidance to return eg. light / map with just the relative position of the player to the house shown
- Thought can only “hold” one item at a time eg. pressing 1 will mean the player is “holding” onto the heirloom so the flashlight will turn off

_NPCs_

- Player thought they are monsters / harmful → maybe we can include a harmless-looking NPC in the intro scene to familiarize the player with interacting with NPCs + understand that they are not harmful
- Purpose of the NPC near the house is unclear
- Could interact with the NPC near the house even when the player is not looking at it
- Mouse control doesn’t work after the player gives eyeballs to the NPC

_Dialogue_

- Too slow and long → might want to flash it out all at once as the player always has to be on the run and has no time to wait for the text to slowly appear
- Unclear that spacebar can skip the dialogue

_Scariness_

- Not that scary after playing once / Less scary the more times the game is played
