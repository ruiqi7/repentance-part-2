# Project 2 Report

Read the [project 2
specification](https://github.com/COMP30019/Project-2-Specification) for
details on what needs to be covered here. You may modify this template as you see fit, but please
keep the same general structure and headings.

Remember that you must also continue to maintain the Game Design Document (GDD)
in the `GDD.md` file (as discussed in the specification). We've provided a
placeholder for it [here](GDD.md).

## Evaluation Plan

### Evaluation techniques
A mix of techniques will be used as listed: 
#### Querying Techniques
  - Interviews — Able to ask more open-ended questions
  - Questionnaires — Easier to quantify the results
#### Observational Techniques
  - Think aloud — Can help to uncover usability issues
  - Cooperative Evaluation — A two-way communication allows for a deeper understanding of the user's thought processes and allows the experimenter to clarify any uncertainties; the experimenter can gain insight into the user's intentions and goals
   
#### Tasks to Perform
  1. Find and collect the heirloom
  2. Collect items for the graves
  3. Complete a task from an NPC
  4. Find and use at least 3 different items
  5. Find all NPCs

### Participants 

#### Target audience 
Set in a maze with horror elements, the game is targeted at players who are drawn to experiencing thrill in a controlled environment. Additionally, the 5-minute time constraint on the game makes it suitable for players who prefer or can only afford to play in short bursts.

#### Participants
Since it is difficult to find participants who specifically match our target audience, the requirement for participants is broadened to be people who enjoy computer games.

#### Recruitment 
Recruiting of participants will be primarily done through friends

### Data collection

#### Types of Data Collected
  - Qualitative (from observational techniques and interview)
  - Quantitative from questionnaires

#### Collection Methods and Tools
  - Google forms for the questionnaire (https://forms.gle/xW9pgmztwRhmoVDX6)
  - Note down the results on a Google Document for the interview and observations

#### Interview Questions
  - Gameplay
      - What did you like most about the gameplay mechanics and dynamics in the game? 
      - What did you not like most about the gameplay mechanics and dynamics in the game?
      - Were there any aspects of the gameplay that you found confusing or frustrating? If so, please describe.
  - Story / Narrative
      - How would you summarize the storyline of the game?
  - Usability of interface
      - Were you at any point in the game confused or lost about what to do?
  - Game Experience
      - How did you feel about the NPCs in this game?
      - How would you describe the monsters in this game?
      - Was there anything in the game that felt out of place? If there was, please describe.
      - What would you consider to be the strongest aspect of this game? (Art, Music, Atmosphere, Story, Gameplay)
      - What would you consider to be the weakest aspect of this game?
      - If there was one thing you could add to this game, what would it be?

##### Interview Results Table
  [**Interviewee Name**]
  | Question | Answer |
  | ---- | ----|
  | … | … |

#### Questionnaire Questions 
The participant will rank each question on a scale of 1-5

| Question | Scale |
|----|----|
|I found the game challenging | Strongly disagree - strongly agree|
|I found the game enjoyable | Strongly disagree - strongly agree|
|I found the maze to be of a reasonable size and complexity | Strongly disagree - strongly agree|
|I found finding items... | Very difficult - very easy |
|I found the items.. | Not useful - very useful |
|I understood the storyline | Not at all - completely |
|I found the storyline engaging | not at all - very |
|I found the game controls... | Confusing - intuitive |
|I felt that the art and assets used were fitting to the theme of the game | Strongly disagree - strongly agree |
|I found the monsters scary | Not at all - extremely |
|I found the atmosphere and environment scary | Not at all - extremely |
|The game audio contributed to the horror experience | Not at all - a lot |
|I felt that 'Repentance' was a unique gaming experience | Strongly disagree - strongly agree |
|I would play the game again | Never - definitely |

### Data analysis
#### Analysing the qualitative data
  - Data will be categorised so that common themes can be seen
  - Within each theme look for commonalities to link them
  - Determine how the different themes relate to each other
  - Based on the common ideas found construct a priority list of changes that can be made to address the issues identified 
#### Analysing the quantitative data
  - Look for trends in responses 
  - Construct graphs to aid visualization of the result
  - Based on the averages of results for each question, construct priority list of changes that can be made to address the issues identified

### Timeline
  - Ideally, the evaluation should be completed early enough to allow time to make any necessary changes to the game (2 weeks → 17 October). Changes to the game will be made after completing the evaluations and discussing results.
  - Due date of evaluation report: Tuesday 31 October
### Responsibilities
A list of tasks has been created and will be equally delegated to each team member depending on workload. However, certain tasks may be done in a joint effort or will be compartmentalized. For example, each team member will be responsible for interviewing and collecting the data for their chosen participants.

  - Conduct the evaluations and gather participants
  - Analyse observability results
  - Analyse questionnaire results
  - Analyse interview results
  - Summarize findings from all analysis 
  - Discuss game changes / improvements and discuss priorities
